# MimicCog

## Project Description

In this project, we have used OpenCV and Transfer Learning methods to implement Real-Time Object Detection and then interpreting those objects as "Emojis" as defined by Unicode Consortium.
We have used YOLO v4 object detection algorithm and Tensorflow to implement these features. We have used the pre-trained 100-image classifier dataset, and implemented it in the same.


### Features implemented so far

### Features left to be implemented
- Implementing a GUI 
- Packaging the code as an .exe executable file
- Emotion Detection
- 3-D Face Emulation
